# Hands-On-Demo-Logging-Amazon-Titan-Model-Calls-in-Real-Time
This project shows how I used Amazon Titan via AWS Bedrock and logged the full model interaction using CloudWatch. It captures inputs, outputs, token usage, and timestamps in real time. The setup helps monitor, debug, and trace generative AI workflows efficiently, making it production-ready and easy to analyze.
